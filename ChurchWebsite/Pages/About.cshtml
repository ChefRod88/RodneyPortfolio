                <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mb-4">Our Beliefs</h2>
                <p class="text-muted mb-4">We are a Missionary Baptist church. We affirm the Baptist Faith and Message as a faithful summary of biblical teaching.</p>

                <div class="about-belief-item">
                    <h3>The Word of God</h3>
                    <p>We believe that the Bible is the Word of God, fully inspired and without error in the original manuscripts, written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and that it has supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct.</p>
                    <p class="scripture mb-0">II Timothy 3:16; II Peter 1:20-21; Mark 13:31; John 8:31-32; John 20:31; Acts 20:32</p>

                <div class="about-belief-item">
                    <h3>The Trinity</h3>
                    <p>We believe that there is one living and true God, eternally existing in three persons; that these are equal in every divine perfection, and that they execute distinct but harmonious offices in the work of creation, providence and redemption.</p>
                    <p class="scripture mb-0">Genesis 1:1,26; John 1:1,3; Matthew 28:19; John 4:24; Romans 1:19-20; Ephesians 4:5-6</p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-belief-item">
                    <h3>God the Father</h3>
                    <p>We believe in God the Father, an infinite, personal spirit, perfect in holiness, wisdom, power and love. We believe that He infallibly foreknows all that shall come to pass, that He concerns Himself mercifully in the affairs of men, that He hears and answers prayer, and that He saves from sin and death all who come to Him through Jesus Christ.</p>
                    <p class="scripture mb-0">Luke 10:21-22; Matthew 23:9; John 3:16; John 6:27; Romans 1:7; I Timothy 1:1-2; I Timothy 2:5-6; I Peter 1:3; Revelation 1:6</p>

                <div class="about-belief-item">
                    <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
                    <p>We believe in Jesus Christ, God's only begotten Son, conceived by the Holy Spirit. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, and teachings. We believe in His substitutionary atoning death, bodily resurrection, ascension into heaven, perpetual intercession for His people, and personal visible return to earth.</p>
                    <p class="scripture mb-0">Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 1:26-38; John 1:1; John 20:28; Romans 9:5; II Corinthians 5:21; I Peter 2:21-23; John 20:30-31; Matthew 20:28; Ephesians 1:4; Acts 1:11; Romans 5:6-8; Romans 6:9-10; Hebrews 7:25; Hebrews 9:28; I Timothy 3:16</p>

                <div class="about-belief-item">
                    <h3>Holy Spirit</h3>
                    <p>We believe in the Holy Spirit who came forth from the Father and Son to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment, and to regenerate, sanctify, and empower all who believe in Jesus Christ. We believe that the Holy Spirit indwells every believer in Christ, and that He is an abiding helper, teacher and guide.</p>
                    <p class="scripture mb-0">John 14:16-17,26; John 15:26-27; John 16:9-14; Romans 8:9; I Corinthians 3:16; I Corinthians 6:19; Galatians 5:22-26</p>

                <div class="about-belief-item">
                    <h3>Regeneration</h3>
                    <p>We believe that man was created by God in His own image; that he sinned and thereby incurred physical, spiritual and eternal death, which is separation from God; that as a consequence, all human beings are born with a sinful nature and are sinners by choice and therefore under condemnation. We believe that those who repent and forsake sin and trust Jesus Christ as Savior are regenerated by the Holy Spirit and become new creatures, delivered from condemnation and receive eternal life.</p>
                    <p class="scripture mb-0">Genesis 1:26; Genesis 2:17; Genesis 5:2; Eccl. 2:11; John 3:14; John 5:24; John 5:30; John 8:12; John 10:26; Romans 9:22; II Thessalonians 1:9; Rev. 19:20; Rev. 20:10,14,15; Psalm 51:7; Jeremiah 17:9; James 1:14; Romans 3:19; Romans 5:19; Proverbs 28:13; I John 1:9; John 3:16; John 1:13; II Corinthians 5:17; Romans 8:1</p>

                <div class="about-belief-item">
                    <h3>The Church</h3>
                    <p>We believe in the universal church, a living spiritual body of which Christ is the head and all regenerated persons are members. We believe in the local church, consisting of a company of believers in Jesus Christ, baptized on a credible profession of faith, and associated for worship, work, and fellowship. We believe that God has laid upon the members of the local church the primary task of giving the gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost world.</p>

                <div class="about-belief-item">
                    <h3>The Christian & The Social Order</h3>
                    <p>All Christians are under obligation to seek to make the will of Christ supreme in our own lives and in human society. In the spirit of Christ, Christians should oppose racism, every form of greed, selfishness, and vice, and all forms of sexual immorality. We should work to provide for the orphaned, the needy, the abused, the aged, the helpless, and the sick. We should speak on behalf of the unborn and contend for the sanctity of all human life from conception to natural death.</p>
